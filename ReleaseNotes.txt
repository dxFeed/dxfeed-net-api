* [DXFC-174] Added the ability to subscribe to regional quotes. Now Quote subscription requests both composite and regional events. Please, use the `Scope` field to filter events.

Version 5.9.0
* [Samples] Added the ability to connect with token in a dxf_events_sample
* Added the ability to override the type of data the application subscribes to
  - Added EventSubscriptionFlag enum with possible values:
    - `Default` that used for default dubscription behaviour
    - `ForceTicker` that used to force subscription to ticker data
    - `ForceStream` that used to force subscription to stream data
    - `ForceHistory` that used to force subscription to history data
  - Added the new `NativeSubscription` constructors and `NativeConnection.CreateSubscription` methods with additional parameter `eventSubscriptionFlags`.
  - [Samples] Added an additional command line parameter "[-s <subscr_data>]" to `dxf_client` (to describe how to use the new function with flags). 
    This parameter accepts the next values:
    - 'TICKER' or 'ticker' to force subscription to ticker data
    - 'STREAM' or 'stream' to force subscription to stream data
    - 'HISTORY' or 'history' to force subscription to history data
* Added the `Tick` field to non ETH Trades.
  The `Tick` field Returns Trend indicator – in which direction price is moving. The values are: Up (Tick = 1), Down (Tick = 2), and Undefined (Tick = 0).
  The `Tick` field should be used if `IDxTradeBase.TickDirection` is `Undefined`
* Fixed the `Direction` enum.
  Now `Down` = 1 and `ZeroDown` = 2
* Added the candle price level attribute support. The candle price level (pl) defines additional axis to split candles within particular price corridor in addition 
  to candle period attribute with the default value Double.NaN.
  So a one-minute candles of "AAPL" with price level 0.1 shall be specified with "AAPL{=m,pl=0.1}".
  - Added the `CandlePriceLevel` attribute class
  - Added the `PriceLevel` field to `CandleSymbol` class
  - Added additional utility methods to `CandleSymbolAttributes`:
    - The static constructor method `PriceLevel.NewPriceLevel` to construct PriceLevel from double precision floating point value
    - The static constructor method `PriceLevel.NewPriceLevel` to construct PriceLevel by string parsing

  Example: `dxf_client demo.dxfeed.com:7300 Candle AAPL{=m,pl=0.1} 2020-01-01`
* Added ability to retrieve regional TnS. Now API backend (C-API) subsribes to both composite and regional TimeAndSale events. 
  Sometimes server may sent equal composite and regional TnS which differ by suffix only (for example: TimeAndSale and TimeAndSale&K). 
  So the `Scope` field was added with possible values: `Composite` and `Regional` to `IDxTimeAndSale`, `NativeTimeAndSale`. Same field was added for 
  `IDxSummary` and `NativeSummary` events. 
  Please, use the `Scope` field to filter out duplicates.

Version 5.8.0
* Improved the documentation (converted to doxygen format)
* Added a sample that implements subscribing to symbols which downloaded from IPF. See the dxf_connect_ipf_sample project
* Fixed the InstrumentProfileConnection class that does not respond after downloading all data

Version 5.7.0
* Fixed an issue with crash on reconnect (connection by TLS)
* Added the ability to subscribe to "*" (wildcard) symbol
  - See descriptions of the `NativeSubscription.AddSymbol`, `NativeSubscription.AddSymbols`, `NativeSubscription.RemoveSymbols` methods in the NativeSubscription.cs

Version 5.6.3
* Fixed multiple symbols subscription in samples on Linux
* Fixed formatting and logging of indices, strings, timestamps and identifiers on Linux

Version 5.6.2
* Subscription process was accelerated by sorting internal symbol collection

Version 5.6.1
* Fixed an issue with incorrect index field calculation

Version 5.6.0
* Fixed Snapshot sample. Unused event type parameter has been removed.

Version 5.5.2
* Fixed a memory leak in ServerMessageProcessor

Version 5.5.1
* Data collection in OrderViewSubscription has been greatly accelerated

Version 5.5.0
* Fixed an issue with error "HRESULT: 0x8007000B" in the samples
* Added a TLS 1.1+ support to instrument profile and option chain samples
* Fixed an issue with concurrent modification of record digests data
* Updated the Series API to QDS 3.271
* Fixed a Series snapshot data processing

Version 5.4.0
* Notifications for connection status changes
  - the ability to notify about changes in the connection status is added. 
    See: com.dxfeed.api.connection.ConnectionStatus enum, com.dxfeed.native.NativeConnection class 
    and com.dxfeed.native.NativeConnection.Status field
* [Samples] Expand the parameter set by passing an authentication token
  - The optional command line parameter "[-T <token>]" is added
* [Samples] Add the ability to change the number of displayed records
  - The optional command line parameter "[-l records_print_limit]" is added (0 - unlimited).
  - Affected samples: dxf_client, dxf_order_view_sample, dxf_snapshot_sample
* dxf_simple_order_book has been renamed to dxf_simple_order_book_sample

Version 5.3.2
+ Regional book is added

Version 5.3.0:
+ Add support of regional and composite events for trades and quotes
+ Add API functions to get current address and other properties from connection

Version 5.2.3:
* Fix authentication with Auther other than
  default Login/Password one.

Version 5.2.2
* Fix "Side" enum.
* Fix ToString() of events with EventFlags.

Version 5.2.1
* Link all created subscriptions to their connections
  to prevent GC from collecting live subscription objects.

Version 5.2.0
+ All events are synchronized with C API and Java API
  Many small changes in field names.
+ Some utility data is moved to com.dxfeed.api.data namespace,
  please include it as needed.

+ Add all samples to package.

Version 5.1.0
+ Implement Entitlement API for C#.
+ Implement support for different connection schemes.
+ Implement support for SSL/TLS.
+ Implement simple Future/Promise API
