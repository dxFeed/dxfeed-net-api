* [DXFC-178] Added the ability to log received and transmitted data blocks
  - [API] The `NativeTools.InitializeLogging` function extended by optional parameter `logDataTransfer`
    This flag defining the logging mode; if it's `true` then the data transfer (portions of received and sent data) logging will be enabled.
    It will also create two files with names similar to the name of the main log file, but ending with "*.receive.data" and "*.send.data"
  - [Samples] Added the additional command line parameter:
    - `-p` - Enables the data transfer logging

Version 5.10.0
* [DXFC-173] [Samples] Added additional command line parameters to the `dxf_simple_order_book_sample` sample:
  - host:port - The address of dxfeed server (exmaple: demo.dxfeed.com:7300)
  - symbol    - The instrument symbol: IBM, MSFT, AAPL, ...
  - date      - The date of time series event in the format YYYY-MM-DD
  - source    - The source for order events (default: NTV): NTV,NFX,ESPD,XNFI,ICE,ISE,DEA,DEX,BYX,BZX,BATE,CHIX,CEUX,BXTR,IST,BI20,ABE,FAIR,GLBX,ERIS,XEUR,CFE,SMFE
  -l <limit>  - The number of displayed bids or asks in a order book (0 - unlimited [FOD], default: 10)
  -T <token>  - The authorization token
* [DXFC-174] Added the ability to subscribe to regional quotes. Now Quote subscription requests both composite and regional events. Please, use the `Scope` field to filter events.
* [DXFC-168] The list of supported order sources was updated: NTV,NFX,ESPD,XNFI,ICE,ISE,DEA,DEX,BYX,BZX,BATE,CHIX,CEUX,BXTR,IST,BI20,ABE,FAIR,GLBX,ERIS,XEUR,CFE,SMFE

Version 5.9.0
* [Samples] Added the ability to connect with token in a dxf_events_sample
* Added the ability to override the type of data the application subscribes to
  - Added EventSubscriptionFlag enum with possible values:
    - `Default` that used for default dubscription behaviour
    - `ForceTicker` that used to force subscription to ticker data
    - `ForceStream` that used to force subscription to stream data
    - `ForceHistory` that used to force subscription to history data
  - Added the new `NativeSubscription` constructors and `NativeConnection.CreateSubscription` methods with additional parameter `eventSubscriptionFlags`.
  - [Samples] Added an additional command line parameter "[-s <subscr_data>]" to `dxf_client` (to describe how to use the new function with flags). 
    This parameter accepts the next values:
    - 'TICKER' or 'ticker' to force subscription to ticker data
    - 'STREAM' or 'stream' to force subscription to stream data
    - 'HISTORY' or 'history' to force subscription to history data
* Added the `Tick` field to non ETH Trades.
  The `Tick` field Returns Trend indicator – in which direction price is moving. The values are: Up (Tick = 1), Down (Tick = 2), and Undefined (Tick = 0).
  The `Tick` field should be used if `IDxTradeBase.TickDirection` is `Undefined`
* Fixed the `Direction` enum.
  Now `Down` = 1 and `ZeroDown` = 2
* Added the candle price level attribute support. The candle price level (pl) defines additional axis to split candles within particular price corridor in addition 
  to candle period attribute with the default value Double.NaN.
  So a one-minute candles of "AAPL" with price level 0.1 shall be specified with "AAPL{=m,pl=0.1}".
  - Added the `CandlePriceLevel` attribute class
  - Added the `PriceLevel` field to `CandleSymbol` class
  - Added additional utility methods to `CandleSymbolAttributes`:
    - The static constructor method `PriceLevel.NewPriceLevel` to construct PriceLevel from double precision floating point value
    - The static constructor method `PriceLevel.NewPriceLevel` to construct PriceLevel by string parsing

  Example: `dxf_client demo.dxfeed.com:7300 Candle AAPL{=m,pl=0.1} 2020-01-01`
* Added ability to retrieve regional TnS. Now API backend (C-API) subsribes to both composite and regional TimeAndSale events. 
  Sometimes server may sent equal composite and regional TnS which differ by suffix only (for example: TimeAndSale and TimeAndSale&K). 
  So the `Scope` field was added with possible values: `Composite` and `Regional` to `IDxTimeAndSale`, `NativeTimeAndSale`. Same field was added for 
  `IDxSummary` and `NativeSummary` events. 
  Please, use the `Scope` field to filter out duplicates.

  - The optional command line parameter "[-T <token>]" is added
* [Samples] Add the ability to change the number of displayed records
  - The optional command line parameter "[-l records_print_limit]" is added (0 - unlimited).
  - Affected samples: dxf_client, dxf_order_view_sample, dxf_snapshot_sample
